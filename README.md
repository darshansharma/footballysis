# soccer-player-rank-predictor
Soccer player rank predictor predicts the performance of players in today's match based on their past perforamnce.

Currently I am enrolled in Andrew Ng's course of machine learning on courseera and making this to test my knowledge of linear regression. I will update this project as I will learn further in this course.

I will use Supervised learning method of machine learning to predict the performance of player in today's match. Now first we will se what is machine learning and then what is supervised learning.

### WHAT IS MACHINE LEARNING ###
Machine learning is the ability of machine to learn a thing without being explictly programmed. Or
If a machine has a experience E and performance P for some list of tasks T then machine learning is defined as if the performance P for some tasks T increases with experirce E.

Machine learning --> Supervised learningg
		 --> Unsupervised learning

### WHAT IS SUPERVISED LEARNING ###
Supervised learning is the form of machine learning in which we give machine some sort of data and based on the pattern that machine founds on that data we will predict what we want related to that data. To predict the performance of player in today's match we will give machine some data and in this case that will be performances of players in past few matches.

Supervised learning --> Regression model
		    --> Classification model

Now I will not dig that much deeper. Directly saying, we will use regression model of supervised learning to predict performance of players.

Now I think this much is sufficient for theory part and now let's jump to implementation. 

To need past data of players we will use ##### pyfootball ##### library #####in python.
